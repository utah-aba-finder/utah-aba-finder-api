# Service Types Synchronization

## Overview
Synchronized the `PracticeType` model with the Provider Registration system to ensure consistency between new provider registrations and existing provider profile updates.

## Changes Made
- **Before**: PracticeType had 5 mismatched service types
- **After**: PracticeType now has exactly 12 service types matching Provider Registration

## Final Service Types (12 total)
1. ABA Therapy (ID: 75)
2. Occupational Therapy (ID: 76)
3. Autism Evaluations (ID: 77)
4. Dentists (ID: 78)
5. Pediatricians (ID: 79)
6. Orthodontists (ID: 80)
7. Coaches/Mentors (ID: 81)
8. Advocates (ID: 82)
9. Speech Therapy (ID: 83)
10. Barbers/Hairstylist (ID: 84)
11. Physical Therapists (ID: 85)
12. Therapists (ID: 86)

## Database Commands Executed
